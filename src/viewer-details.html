        <h4>Flood Gages</h4>
        <p>
        The data presented in this application is collected from both public and private contributors. 
        Flood gage readings are acquired from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service
        (NOAA NWS). The data within this application is pulled directly from NOAA's database and displayed within this
        application. The viewer refreshes the flood gage data from NOAA every 5 minutes however, NOAA may take up to one
        hour for their gages to officially update.
        </p>
        <h4>Weather Radar</h4>
        <p>
        Weather Radar data are acquired from the Aeris Maps Platform (AMP). This is a national dataset
        displaying rain, snow, and ice precipitation in decibel relative to Z (dBZ) units. By default, the Weather Radar layer
        displays the most recent still radar. By pressing the “PLAY” button in the bottom left corner of the map, the layer
        will animate, cycling through 5 still radar captures spanning approximately 4 hours and 10 minutes at approximately 50
        minute intervals. The application refreshes the weather radar data from the AMP every 6 minutes. This is the same
        interval Aeris updates the radar data. For more information on the Weather Radar, please visit the
        <a href="https://www.aerisweather.com/ ">Aeris Weather Website</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Weather Alerts</h4>
        <p>
        Weather Alerts are acquired from the Aeris Weather API. This is a national dataset of all active US
        advisories issued by the National Weather Service (NWS).  The NWS issues a variety of severe weather warnings,
        watches, advisories, and statements that may be issued for a single forecast zone or county, or for a large region.
        The application refreshes the weather alerts data from the Aeris Weather API every 1 minute. For more information on
        the Weather Alerts, please visit the <a href="https://www.aerisweather.com/ ">Aeris Weather Website</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Lake Conditions</h4>
        <p>
        Lake Conditions are acquired from the Texas Water Development Board's Water Data for Texas (WDFT)
        project. This is a Texas statewide dataset displaying current lake water storage levels as part of a graphical display
        including storage levels up to 13 months before the current date. The application refreshes the weather alerts data
        from the WDFT database every 30 minutes. For more information on the Lake Conditions, please visit the
        <a href="https://waterdatafortexas.org/">Water Data for Texas Website</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Gage Notifications (Subscriptions)</h4>
        <p>
        The viewer provides the ability for users to “subscribe” to flood gages to receive alerts when gage readings are
        at potentially dangerous levels. These levels are designated as Action, Minor, Moderate, and Major flood stages.
        Users may subscribe to any gage to receive alerts via Short Message Service (SMS) text message.
        </p>
        <p>
        (Note: The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) maintains a strict <a href="http://www.twdb.texas.gov/policies/site/index.asp">
        privacy policy</a> and will not utilize user contact information for any purpose other than that for which the user has signed up.)
        </p>
        <p>
        A single alert is sent out for each individual gage when it enters one of the levels mentioned above. As water levels
        continue to change during a weather event, single alerts will continue to be sent out as a gage transitions through
        the various stage levels.  A user can subscribe to multiple gages by subscribing to each gage individually.   
        </p>
        <p>
        To unsubscribe from alerts, click the “MY GAGE ALERTS” button within the left panel of the application. This will
        open the subscription management dialog where the user can review all the gages they are currently subscribed to.
        The user can modify or remove any subscription they no longer wish to receive. Subscriptions and alert messages are
        managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
