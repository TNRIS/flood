      <h4>Flood Gages</h4>
      <p>
      The data presented in this application is collected from both public and private contributors. 
      Flood gage readings are acquired from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service
      (NOAA NWS). The data within this application is pulled directly from NOAA's database and displayed within this
      application. The viewer refreshes the flood gage data from NOAA every 5 minutes however, NOAA may take up to one
      hour for their gages to officially update.
      </p>
      <h4>Weather Radar</h4>
      <p>
      Weather Radar data are acquired from the Aeris Maps Platform (AMP). This is a national dataset
      displaying rain, snow, and ice precipitation in decibel relative to Z (dBZ) units. By default, the Weather Radar layer
      displays the most recent still radar. By pressing the “PLAY” button in the bottom left corner of the map, the layer
      will animate, cycling through 5 still radar captures spanning approximately 4 hours and 10 minutes at approximately 50
      minute intervals. The application refreshes the weather radar data from the AMP every 6 minutes. This is the same
      interval Aeris updates the radar data. For more information on the Weather Radar, please visit Aeris Weather's website
      at: https://www.aerisweather.com/ 
      </p>
      <h4>Weather Alerts</h4>
      <p>
      Weather Alerts are acquired from the Aeris Weather API. This is a national dataset of all active US
      advisories issued by the National Weather Service (NWS).  The NWS issues a variety of severe weather warnings,
      watches, advisories, and statements that may be issued for a single forecast zone or county, or for a large region.
      The application refreshes the weather alerts data from the Aeris Weather API every 1 minute. For more information on
      the Weather Alerts, please visit Aeris Weather's website at: https://www.aerisweather.com/ 
      </p>
      <h4>Lake Conditions</h4>
      <p>
      Lake Conditions are acquired from the Texas Water Development Board's Water Data for Texas (WDFT)
      project. This is a Texas statewide dataset displaying current lake water storage levels as part of a graphical display
      including storage levels up to 13 months before the current date. The application refreshes the weather alerts data
      from the WDFT database every 30 minutes. For more information on the Lake Conditions, please visit the WDFT website
      at: https://waterdatafortexas.org/
      </p>
      <h4>Gage Notifications (Subscriptions)</h4>
      <p>
      The viewer provides the ability for users to “subscribe” to flood gages to
      receive alerts when gage readings are at potentially dangerous levels. These levels are designated as Action, Minor,
      Moderate, and Major flood stages.  Users may subscribe to any gage to receive alerts via Short Message Service (SMS)
      text message or email.
      </p>
      <p>
      (Note: TNRIS maintains a strict privacy policy and will never, under any circumstance, share or disclose a user’s
      contact information with any other entities or utilize their contact information for any purpose other than that for
      which the user has signed up.)
      </p>
      <p>
      A single alert is sent out for each individual gage when it enters one of the levels mentioned above. As water levels
      continue to change during a weather event, single alerts will continue to be sent out as a gage transitions through
      the various stage levels.  A user can subscribe to multiple gages by the subscribing to each gage individually.   
      </p>
      <p>
      To unsubscribe from alerts, click the “My gage Alerts” button within the left panel of the application. This will
      open the subscription management dialog where the user can review all the gages they are currently subscribed.  The
      user can modify or remove any subscription they no longer wish to receive. Subscriptions and alert messages are
      managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
      </p>
      <p>
      Alternative to the subscription management dialog, AWS provides default functionality which allows the user to
      unsubscribe from alerts directly from the alert message itself. Every email alert provides a direct link within the
      message which you can click to unsubscribe the email address from the gage which sent the alert.
